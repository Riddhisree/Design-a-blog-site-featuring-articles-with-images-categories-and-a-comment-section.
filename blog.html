                <h3 class="title">Mango Phirni – Rice Custard Pots</h3>
                <p class="text">Phirni or Firni is creamy smooth ground rice custard flavoured with aromatic rose
                    water. Served in small, shallow, wide-rimmed terracotta bowls, these never fail to transport me
                    to lavish Muslim functions we celebrated with our friends in India. A bowl of fragrant firni was
                    the most apt finale to a ghee-laden biryani, kebab and paratha meal. Saying that, I like to whip
                    these up as a quick desert and teatime treats for unexpected visitors. With mangoes in shops
                    aplenty in spring and summer, a topping of the fresh Alphonso, the King of Fruits, adds to the
                    decadent feel of this dessert. As they are highly fragrant, I’ve omitted the rose water. Stir
                    through two teaspoons when the custard is cooked, if you decide on a version without the mango
                    layer. See my other recipes for the London Evening Standard newspaper here.</p>
                <p class="text">Ingredients:<br>
                    Feeds 6::<br>
                    i) 1 pint whole milk<br>
                    ii)50gm rice flour<br>
                    iii) 3-4 tbsp caster sugar<br>
                    iv) Seeds of four green cardamoms<br>
                    v)2 Alphonso mangoes<br>
                    vi) 12 pistachios</p>
                <p class="text">Method:<br>
                    First stir the rice flour into 200 ml of the milk, making a thick paste. Crush the cardamoms in
                    a pestle and mortar.Bring the remaining milk to boil in a heavy bottomed pan on a medium high
                    heat. Use a whisk to keep stirring.When it starts bubbling, lower the heat to a simmer, and stir
                    in the rice and milk mixture, as well as the sugar to your preference. I found three tablespoons
                    added enough sweetness. Use your whisk to stir the mixture. You want the rice to cook slowly
                    without burning the milk.In about 5-7 minutes, you will see the mixture thickening to a custard
                    that coats the whisk. Now, turn the heat off, stir in the cardamom and pour into six little
                    bowls. Let the firni cool slightly then pop them into the fridge.While they are setting, wash,
                    peel, slice and puree the mangoes. Get your pots out of the fridge, and carefully spoon even
                    amounts of the puree on top of each firni layer.Crush and sprinkle the pistachios and chill
                    covered until you’re ready to eat.<br>The Mango Phirni will keep for three to four days covered
                    in the fridge. Try smothered with chopped berries instead of mangoes for a change.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Where to stay in Melbourne: The best neighbourhood for your Visit </h3>
                <p class="text">Melbourne is probably my favorite city in Australia. While Sydney boasts the more
                    iconic tourist attractions, Melbourne is more laid-back and a hub for arts and culture.Home to
                    over five million people, it has a diverse population and something of a European feel, home to
                    plenty of festivals, art exhibitions, live music, stunning street art, chill bars and cafés, and
                    delicious food. You could easily spend over a week here and only scratch the surface when it
                    comes to things to see and do.</p>
                <p class="text">To help you decide where to stay in Melbourne, in this post, I’ll highlight the best
                    neighborhoods below so you can choose the area that suits your travel style and budget as the
                    neighborhoods in this city all have their own feel.</p>
                <p class="text">But, before I get to the specifics, here are some common questions I get asked about
                    neighborhoods in Melbourne:</p>
                <p class="text">What’s the best neighborhood for first-time visitors?<br>
                    City Center, or “the CBD,” as locals are prone to call it, has something that will please most
                    travelers. It’s crammed with great museums, monuments, cafés, restaurants, and bars. It’s the
                    most central spot for doing lots of sightseeing.</p>
                <p class="text">What’s the best neighborhood for shopping?<br>
                    Shopaholics will be in heaven along boutique-lined Chapel Street in South Yarra.</p>
                <p class="text">What’s the best neighborhood for foodies?<br>
                    Fitzroy is laden with incredible eateries — from classic and traditional bites to cutting-edge
                    spots. I also think this is just a cool area to hang out in too</p>

                    <h3 class="title">The Mystery Of White Holes: Could They Solve The Enigma Of Dark Matter?</h3>
                    <p class="text">Scientists are becoming increasingly convinced that white holes, the exact opposite
                        of black holes, may actually exist. These hypothetical objects, predicted by Einstein’s general
                        theory of relativity, can only eject matter and light, making it impossible for anything to
                        enter them. While black holes have been observed and studied extensively, the existence of white
                        holes has remained a mystery.However, recent developments in a theory called loop quantum
                        gravity suggest that white holes could be the final stage in the evolution of black holes.
                        According to this theory, space itself is made up of individual grains or quanta, and when
                        matter inside a black hole reaches these incredibly tiny scales, a quantum repulsive force
                        causes it to bounce back, transforming the black hole into a white hole.</p>
                    <p class="text">“A fundamental change then occurs. Spacetime generates a sort of quantum repulsive
                        force that opposes the collapse and causes the matter to bounce back,” explains Carlo Rovelli, a
                        physicist at the CPT1 and one of the originators of this hypothesis.While this scenario solves
                        several problems associated with black holes, such as the singularity and the information
                        paradox, it raises the question of why we don’t observe white holes lighting up around us. The
                        answer lies in the flexibility of time, as described by general relativity. The extreme
                        gravitational effects near a black hole’s event horizon cause time to pass much more slowly
                        compared to a distant observer, meaning that the transformation of a black hole into a white
                        hole could take billions of years from our perspective.</p>
                    <p class="text">Scientists are now focusing on the search for primordial black holes, which are
                        thought to have formed shortly after the Big Bang. These tiny black holes may have already begun
                        to transform into white holes, potentially emitting short, intense flashes of gamma rays or
                        becoming stable, barely perceptible objects that contribute to the mysterious dark matter that
                        makes up 27% of the Universe.</p>
                    <p class="text">“Loop quantum gravity equations enable us to precisely calculate the mass of these
                        white holes, which is on the order of a microgram. That might seem negligible, but added
                        together, all those white holes may make up a significant proportion of dark matter,” Rovelli
                        explains.</p>
